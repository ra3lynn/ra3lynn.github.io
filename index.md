## My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

***Lab 3, part 2**

*  The second part of this lab was one of my favorites because I always struggle with figuring out the number of days between two different dates. Most of the time I search it up, but with this lab I was able to write functions that could help calculate date differences. 

**Lab 8, part 2**

* This second part of lab 8 was another one of my favorites. I thought this lab was really interesting because the program made a cool pattern as the output. Even though the pattern would be difficult to make typing out each individual character this lab used 3 loops to create the pattern.

**Lab 10, part 1**

* Lab 10 was one of my favorites because I thought it was pretty interesting seeing how California's population is distributed between all the counties. Additionally, I was able to learn about counties that I have never learned before as a born and raised Californian. For this lab 2D vectors were used to search through and find the population of the specific county given.
